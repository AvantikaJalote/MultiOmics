# MultiOmics
# MultiOmics
Automated ETL Pipeline for Multi-Omics Cancer Data Integration.

This project builds a cloud-based system to ingest and process diverse cancer data types
(genomic, imaging, clinical) from TCGA and CCLE, transform them using Apache Spark and
quantum-inspired algorithms, and load them into a Neo4j graph database for analysis.

## Structure
- extract/        # Data extraction scripts (e.g., TCGA downloader)
- transform/      # Data transformation & feature engineering scripts
- load/           # Loading data into Neo4j graph database
- docs/           # Documentation and notes

## How to Run
1. Run extraction scripts to download datasets.
2. Run transformation scripts for feature engineering.
3. Load transformed data into Neo4j.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Apache Spark
- Neo4j
- AWS CLI & credentials
